This place...

It never occurred to me how much it would change.

It has become something so very different from what I used to know. <LINE>It is almost unrecognisable.

But it is beautiful.

It almost gives me a naïve hope that maybe these long eternities wont be so bad - <LINE>Sitting upon my perch, watching the world crumble and reform.

...

Very naïve. <LINE>An eternity is an eternity. When I have seen it all before, I will keep on seeing.

The universe doesn't care how restless I become. <LINE>I will still be here, always.

Oh small creature, how I envy you.

At least you have... a chance.

Our consciousnesses are parting ways now, friend. Goodbye.
